# monopolyGame

Final Project
You will be working individually to design and build a monopoly game.
You will be evaluated on code efficiency and organization, process, documentation, the degree of
difficulty, cohesiveness and flow of program, application of learned concepts and final project
execution.
You must incorporate into your project the following concepts that we learned in class:
Objects 1 Sorting Algorithm

1 Searching Algorithm Multi-dimension arrays

1 Stack or Queue or
Linked List

Inheritance and
Polymorphism

Text File Input and
Output Recursion Everything else!

Step 1: Project details
- Brainstorm ideas for project. Obtain approval from teacher on your ideas
- Work log (google doc) that includes Create and share: Jan 09, 2023 Submit: Jan 23, 2023
o File name: ICS4U_FP_Worklog_Name
o Create today and write daily on either of the following:
 Description of what you worked on / accomplished during class time
 And/ Or Description of problems you encountered
 And/ Or Any changes to your original plan that you had to do (Highlight those)
- Proposal (google doc) that includes: Submit: Jan 11, 2023
o File name: ICS4U_FP_Proposal_Name
o Your program and a description of how it works. If applicable, theme
o Outline of the classes that you plan to use, and how they interact with each other
o Where do you plan to use all the concepts we learned in the course
o Sample of final product that you hope to achieve
o Personal timelines for – planning, coding, testing, final write up (From Jan 9 until Jan 23)
Step 2: Programming
- Start with overall basic structure for your game – add the details as you go
o Class name: ICS4U_FP (The class that includes the main method)
o File name: ICS4U_FP_Code_Name (Create 1 file that has all of your code separated by ----------)
- Add daily to your game to improve your project
- OPTIONAL - Learn one new programming concept that is useful for your program and apply it
Step 3: Testing
- Peer Testing: Done on: Jan 18, 2023 in class
o Have a working game – not necessarily fully complete for Jan 18 in class
o When peer testing someone’s work, create a report that includes the following:
 File name: ICS4U_FP_From_Name
 For each student, provide: 3 issues and a description, 2 recommendations, 1 thing you liked
 Share the report with teacher by end of the day
 Include your name, and the person whose work you are evaluating
- Responding to Peer Testing: reviewing feedback given to you
 File name: ICS4U_FP_PeerTesting_Name
 Go through each item in the peer testing report that was given to you; fix the issues, apply
the recommended changes where appropriate; comment on each item

Step 4: Final Project Submission Due: Jan 23, 2023
File name: ICS4U_FP_Final_Name
- Cover Page – program name, course, date, your name
- Table of contents
- Final description of program + instructions if needed
- Current limitations of your program
- Outline where each programming concept learned in class was used, and what it does
- At most 4 min video about your program – do not show your code, just capabilities
- ICS4U_FP_Worklog_Name, ICS4U_FP_TestingPeer_Name
o These should be inside the final file, and submitted separately
- OPTIONAL - A description of one new concept that you learned on your own and applied here
- Final version of your code
o File name: ICS4U_FP_Code_Name
o Include appropriate class and method comments
o Code should be inside the final file, and submitted separately
- Answer to reflection questions:
o How did you projected timelines match up with your actual timelines? Write a paragraph on
what went well, and what were some hiccups along your programming process.
o What are you most proud of in this project?
o What did you find to be most frustrating while working on the project?
o What would you like to add to your program in the future?
o What advice would you give to someone starting to work on this project?
